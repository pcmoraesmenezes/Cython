# Cython

## Introduction

Cython is a superset of the Python programming language, designed to give C-like performance with code
that is written mostly in Python. Cython is a compiled language that is typically used to generate CPython
extension modules. Cython is also often used to write high-performance code for scientific computing and
data science.

## Installation

Cython can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install cython

```

## Usage

Cython code is written in files with the `.pyx` extension. To use Cython is necessary two things:

1. Create a `.pyx` file with the code to be compiled.
2. Create a `setup.py` file to compile the `.pyx` file.
3. The use the `python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace` in the terminal to compile and create the `.c` file.
4. Now create a `.py` file and import the file generated by the compilation.

The `setup.py` will be something like this:

```python
from setuptools import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize("main.pyx")
)

```

## Syntax

The syntax of the `.pyx` file is very similar to the Python syntax, but with some differences. Example:

```cython
cpdef list prime_finder_optimezed(int amount):
    ...
```

VS

```python
def prime_finder_optimezed(amount):
    ...
```

The principal difference is the `cpdef` keyword, that is used to define a function that can be called
from both Python and C code. Another difference is the use of types in the function signature, that is
not necessary in Python.
